// data Type Modifiers : change the meaning of the existing datat type 
/*
--> if sizeof (int)=4 bytes in any os then the numbers of different values stored are 2^32.
--> int can store values from  -2^31 to (2^31)-1 so it can't store 2^32 in it and int will try to store it in it's own 
range and we will get wrong results and probably results a negative number
--> the solution is we can increase the capacity of data storage by changing it's  
data type which can store larger values
