/*
    Types of polymorphism :
    1) compile Time Polymorphism 
        --> occurs at compile ( compilation : huamn to machine language) time 
        --> occurs statically
        --> example: constructor overloading 
        --> function overloading : 
            --> define multiple functions in class with same name 
            --> keep the number of parameters different or parameter type different.

    2) Run Time Polymorphism 
        --> occurs at runtime i,e when program is getting executed
